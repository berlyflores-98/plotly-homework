Week 15 Homework


In this weeks homework we used Plotly to display information about Bellybutton Biodiversity. 
We created a bar chart and a bubble chart.

The way it works is by loading the page, then selecting a Test Subject ID. Once selected it will display a bar chart of the top 10 OTUs and a bubble chart of the total sample and OTUs. 

You can also select another Test Subject and it will load the information.
